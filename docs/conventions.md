## Conventions

### Terminology
`system` = binary system as set of datasets  
`dataset` = an isobaric VLE table

### Variable naming
Since this software is highly mathematical, variable naming is often conventional rather than descriptive or semantical.  
Standard signs for quantities or operators are used, and indexes are marked using `_`, some indexes are used to mark purpose or origin:  
***dif***ference, ***res***idual, ***sum***, ***exp***erimental values, ***cal***culated, ***tab***elated, ***int***erval,  
***M***atrix _(where it'd be unexpected, e.g. serializing vectors to a matrix)_

### Units of measurement
Following units of measurement are used, unless explicitly stated otherwise:
- pressure: `kPa` _(in logarithmic form as well)_
- temperature: `K` everywhere in code except UI, where it's `Â°C`

### Styles
Visual language of charts is following: **black** is main data series, **green** is calculated model.  
Diamonds markers and full lines are used primarily. Auxiliary lines are dotted.  
If dataseries for two components are displayed, then **red** for 1st component, **blue** for 2nd component.
If those two correspond to more volatile and less volatile (as in case of VLE), then `^` and `v` markers will be used, respectively.

### Files

- Tabular input data is in `.tsv` _(human or Excel readable)_.    
- Config is in `.yaml` _(human readable)_.
- Output or intermediate data is in `.json` _(meant as machine-only)_.
