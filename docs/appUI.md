## Typescript frontend

Or `appUI` for short, is a Typescript application which provides a GUI for the [python backend](appPy.md).

It uses Electron runtime, Vite bundler, React framework, and MUI material library.

**Local dev** is done using Electron with Vite dev server and python backend server,  
while **build process** is done using Electron Forge to create an all-inclusive Electron app ~~where python backend runs silently~~.

### Setup
