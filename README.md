A free open-source toolbox for advanced processing of VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) data,
which offers well-known tests of thermodynamic consistency, as well as model fitting using non-linear regression.  
Also includes a novel testing procedure called "gamma offset test", which is described [in a published article](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c04650).
