# VLizard
**a VLE wizard** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öóü¶é

A useful toolbox for evaluation of VLE data (vapor-liquid equilibrium), which comprises tests of thermodynamic consistency & fitting models with non-linear regression.

The project is a monorepo consisting of:
- [Python Core+Backend](docs/appPy.md)
- [Typescript Frontend](docs/appUI.md)

In the initial phase, VLizard is intended as a toolbox for VLE data, but in future its scope may be expanded to include tools for LLE or reaction kinetics data.

Conventions upheld across this repo are summarized [here](docs/conventions.md).

## Setup, run, build
See respective docs for [python backend](docs/appPy.md), [Typescript frontend](docs/appUI.md)
