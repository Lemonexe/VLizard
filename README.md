**a VLE wizard** 🧙‍♂️⚗🦎

A free open-source toolbox for advanced processing of VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) data, which comprises tests of thermodynamic consistency & model fitting using non-linear regression.

App is currently WIP 🚧, but if you'd like to see what it looks like, [see a 3 minute](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BY5ER9d8al4iYIa0OSvPQxuiorSwq9Jj/view?usp=sharing) demo showcasing it from tech perspective 👀

The project is a monorepo consisting of:
- [Python Core+Backend+CLI](docs/appPy.md)
- [Typescript Frontend](docs/appUI.md)

In the initial phase, VLizard is intended as a toolbox for VLE data, but in future its scope may be expanded to include tools for LLE or reaction kinetics data.
