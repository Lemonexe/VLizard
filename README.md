# VLizard
**a VLE wizard** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öóü¶é

A free open-source toolbox for advanced processing of VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) data, which comprises tests of thermodynamic consistency & model fitting using non-linear regression.

The project is a monorepo consisting of:
- [Python Core+Backend+CLI](docs/appPy.md)
- [Typescript Frontend](docs/appUI.md)

In the initial phase, VLizard is intended as a toolbox for VLE data, but in future its scope may be expanded to include tools for LLE or reaction kinetics data.
